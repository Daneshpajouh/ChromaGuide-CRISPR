\chapter{System Architecture and Clinical Deployment}

This chapter details the translation of the CRISPRO-MAMBA-X model into a production-grade clinical system, designed to meet FDA Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) requirements.

\section{End-to-End Clinical System}
The system integrates the Mamba architecture, epigenomic data processing, and conformal prediction into a unified pipeline:

\section{FDA Regulatory Pathway}
We align with the FDA's "V-Model" for software validation, pursuing 510(k) premarket notification as a Class II medical device (Diagnostic Decision Support).

\section{Clinical Decision Support Interface}
The final output is not just a raw score, but a structured clinical report:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{On-Target Efficiency:} with 90\% confidence interval.
    \item \textbf{Off-Target Risk:} Worst-case upper bound across relevant tissues.
    \item \textbf{Safety Flag:} Automatic layout of interactions with known oncogenes (e.g., TP53).
\end{itemize}
This transparent reporting empowers clinicians to make risk-based decisions on patient-specific therapies.
