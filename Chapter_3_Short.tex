\chapter{State-of-the-Art and Critical Limitations}

\section{Evolution of CRISPR Prediction (2014-2025)}
Computational prediction of CRISPR efficiency has evolved from simple linear models to complex deep learning architectures.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{2014 (Doench et al.):} Rule-based linear models ($R \approx 0.70$). Identified PAM-proximal importance but failed to capture non-linear interactions.
    \item \textbf{2018-2019 (DeepHF):} RNN/CNN deep learning models ($R \approx 0.86$). Captured local sequence motifs but restricted to <50bp context.
    \item \textbf{2020 (AttCRISPR):} Attention mechanisms ($R \approx 0.87$). Improved interpretability but still sequence-only.
    \item \textbf{2025 (CRISPR-FMC):} The current SOTA. Uses pre-trained RNA-FM embeddings and cross-modal fusion ($R \approx 0.93$).
\end{itemize}

\section{The Persistence of Unexplained Variance}
Despite reaching $R \approx 0.93$, current models leave approximately **14\% of variance unexplained**.

\subsection{Critical Gaps in SOTA}
Our analysis identifies three primary reasons for this plateau:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Sequence Tunnel Vision:} Models treat DNA as a 1D string, ignoring the 3D chromatin scaffold.
    \item \textbf{Epigenomic Blindness:} Models ignore cell-type specific accessibility (ATAC, Methylation). A guide efficient in T-cells may fail in hepatocytes due to chromatin compaction.
    \item \textbf{Short Context:} The 400bp window misses TAD-scale regulators (enhancers/promoters) located 100kb+ away.
\end{enumerate}

CRISPRO-MAMBA-X is explicitly designed to capture this "Missing 14\%".
