# Playwright Plus MCP Symlink Deployment Log

## Deployment Date
Sun Dec 14 15:49:03 PST 2025

## Configuration Applied
- Symlink: ~/Library/Caches/ms-playwright/mcp-chrome-profile-shared
- Points to: ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default
- MCP Server: @ai-coding-labs/playwright-mcp-plus@latest
- Flags: --project-isolation, --user-data-dir=/Users/studio/Library/Caches/ms-playwright/mcp-chrome-profile-shared

## Backup Created
- Config backup: ~/playwright-mcp-backup.txt
- Rollback guide: ~/ROLLBACK_INSTRUCTIONS.txt

## Symlink Creation
✅ Symlink created successfully
- Location: /Users/studio/Library/Caches/ms-playwright/mcp-chrome-profile-shared
- Target: /Users/studio/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default
- Verified: Readable and accessible

## Configuration Update
✅ Cursor MCP configuration updated
- File: ~/.cursor/mcp.json
- Added: --user-data-dir flag pointing to symlink
- Username: studio

## Tests Performed
- ✅ Symlink creation: Verified
- ✅ Chrome status: Running
- ✅ Configuration updated: Confirmed
- ⏳ Single window auth: Pending Cursor restart
- ⏳ Multi-window auth: Pending Cursor restart

## Next Steps
1. Restart Cursor (user action required)
2. Test single window authentication
3. Test multi-window authentication
4. Verify all windows share authentication

## Result
⏳ DEPLOYMENT IN PROGRESS - Awaiting Cursor restart for final testing

## How to Use After Restart
- Open any Cursor window
- Use browser_navigate to authenticated sites (Perplexity, etc.)
- All windows should share authentication automatically
- No manual login required per window

## Support
If issues occur:
1. Check Chrome is running: `ps aux | grep "Google Chrome" | grep -v grep`
2. Verify symlink: `ls -la ~/Library/Caches/ms-playwright/mcp-chrome-profile-shared`
3. Check Cursor logs: ~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/logs/
4. Review ROLLBACK_INSTRUCTIONS.txt if needed
5. Check configuration: `cat ~/.cursor/mcp.json`

## Notes
- Chrome kept running during deployment (no interruption to active sessions)
- Original Playwright MCP (extension mode) still configured as backup
- Both MCP servers available: playwright-plus (with symlink) and playwright (extension mode)
