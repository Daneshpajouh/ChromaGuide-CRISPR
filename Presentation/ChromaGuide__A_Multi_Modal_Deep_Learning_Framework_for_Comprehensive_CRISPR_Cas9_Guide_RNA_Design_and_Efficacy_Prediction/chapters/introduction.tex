\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Motivation and problem statement}

CRISPR-Cas9 is a programmable RNA-guided nuclease that enables targeted genome editing in eukaryotic cells~\citep{jinek2012,cong2013,hsu2014}. In a standard SpCas9 workflow, a \gRNA{} directs \CasNine\ to a locus adjacent to a \PAM{} (e.g., NGG~\citep{jinek2012}), and downstream repair produces an observed editing outcome.

This proposal targets \emph{on-target efficacy prediction}: given a candidate \gRNA\ and target locus, estimate cleavage/indel efficiency in the \emph{relevant} cellular context. Existing predictors can achieve strong benchmark correlations, but practical deployment remains limited by two recurring issues: (i) models are often sequence-centric and only weakly capture chromatin accessibility/state, and (ii) most models output point estimates without calibrated uncertainty, making it hard to decide when predictions are reliable under dataset/cell-line shift~\citep{horlbeck2016,isaac2016,vovk2005,romano2019,barber2023}.

\section{Primary hypothesis}

\begin{hypothesis}[Multi-modal prediction and calibration]\label{hyp:intro-h1}
\emph{A multi-modal model that fuses sequence and epigenomic features, paired with conformal calibration, will generalize better under dataset/cell-line shift than sequence-only baselines and will produce prediction intervals with reliable empirical coverage.}
\end{hypothesis}

\section{Research objectives (specific aims)}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{On-target efficacy prediction with epigenomic context:} develop a multi-modal predictor that fuses sequence (and optional \gRNA\ structure) with accessibility/histone-mark signals to estimate on-target editing outcomes in the \emph{relevant} chromatin context; include calibrated uncertainty (e.g., conformal prediction intervals) as a secondary deliverable.
\item \textbf{Off-target cleavage site prediction:} predict and rank unintended cleavage sites for a candidate \sgRNA\ by modeling sequence mismatch patterns and local genomic context, producing a genome-wide off-target risk summary suitable for downstream guide selection.
\item \textbf{Integrated \sgRNA\ design score:} combine the on-target predictor and aggregated off-target risk into a single, actionable \sgRNA\ design score that explicitly balances predicted efficiency and specificity, and validate it under leakage-controlled gene-held-out and dataset/cell-line-held-out protocols.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Key gaps addressed (condensed)}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Chromatin context is under-modeled:} accessibility and nucleosome occupancy can modulate Cas9 activity~\citep{horlbeck2016,isaac2016}, but many models remain primarily sequence-driven.
\item \textbf{Uncertainty is rarely calibrated:} prediction intervals with explicit coverage targets are more informative for risk-aware \gRNA\ prioritization than point scores alone~\citep{vovk2005,romano2019}.
\item \textbf{Shift-aware evaluation is essential:} performance can be inflated by leakage and split choice; gene-held-out and cross-domain splits make failure modes visible.
\end{itemize}

\section{Proposed approach: ChromaGuide (overview)}

Recent large-scale benchmarking work highlights that strong within-dataset performance does not always translate to reliable generalization across datasets and cell types~\citep{daneshpajouh2025chromecrispr}.

Motivated by these findings, we position ChromaGuide against both established sequence-based baselines and recent 2025 deep-learning models, including CRISPR\_HNN~\citep{li2025crisprhnn}, PLM-CRISPR~\citep{hou2025plmcrispr}, CRISPR-FMC~\citep{li2025crisprfmc}, DNABERT-Epi~\citep{kimata2025dnabertepi}, and Graph-CRISPR~\citep{jiang2025graph-crispr}, using the ChromeCRISPR benchmark protocols where applicable~\citep{daneshpajouh2025chromecrispr}.

\textbf{ChromaGuide} is a three-module \sgRNA{} prioritization pipeline:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{On-target module:} a multi-modal efficacy predictor that fuses \sgRNA{} sequence (and optional secondary-structure features) with epigenomic context and outputs both a point prediction and conformal prediction intervals.
\item \textbf{Off-target module:} a genome-wide off-target site predictor/ranker that summarizes unintended cleavage risk for each candidate \sgRNA{}.
\item \textbf{Design module:} an integrated \sgRNA{} design score that explicitly balances predicted on-target efficacy against aggregated off-target risk.
\end{enumerate}

Operational success is defined by improved ranking performance on the primary gene-held-out test split (target Spearman $\geq 0.88$ with $\Delta\rho\geq 0.004$ vs. the ChromeCRISPR baseline when evaluated on the same leakage-controlled split; ChromeCRISPR's reported $\rho=0.876$ was obtained under a random 85/15 split~\citep{daneshpajouh2025chromecrispr}) and empirical interval coverage within $\pm 0.02$ of the target level (e.g., 0.90) \emph{under the exchangeability assumption}.
